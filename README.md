This is my personal website

This is a project that I decided to take on in order to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript
I intend to put this in my resume at one point, but for now it is simply a work in progress

I have taken zero templates from the internet and it is all written in plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript
Learning the languages is possible with the help of ChatGPT, W3Schools and ocasionally, Stack Overflow forums
ChatGPT has been used purely for teaching what I do not know how to do, not writing entire blocks of code
It has also not generated any design ideas for the visual design of the website, the way the page navigates, animates and looks is all designed by me
ChatGPT has been nothing but a tool I use to make the ideas in my head a reality as I have had almost zero experience with web design
