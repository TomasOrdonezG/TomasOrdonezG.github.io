            • This is my personal website<br> • This is a project that I decided to take on in order to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript<br> • For now this is simply a work in progress<br> • I have taken zero templates from the internet and it is all written in pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript <br> • Learning the languages is possible with the help of ChatGPT, W3Schools and ocasionally, Stack Overflow forums <br> • ChatGPT has been used purely for teaching what I do not know how to do, not writing entire blocks of code<br> •  It has also not generated any design ideas for the visual design of the website, the way the page navigates, animates and looks is all designed by me <br> • ChatGPT has been nothing but a tool I use to make the ideas in my head a reality as I have had almost zero experience with web design.
